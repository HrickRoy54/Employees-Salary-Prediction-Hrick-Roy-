INTRODUCTION:

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine
whether an individual's annual income is greater than or less than or equal to $50,000, based
on various demographic and employment-related attributes.

This prediction can be valuable for various applications, such as targeted marketing, policy
making, and understanding socio-economic factors influencing income levels.

The project aims to explore different machine learning techniques, preprocess the data
effectively, and evaluate the performance of the models to identify the most suitable approach
for this binary classification task.

LIBRARY USES:

• Mathplotlib for data visualization.
• Boxplot for outline detection. 
• Sklearn for preprocessing, MaxMinScaler for data nornalisation. 
• Train_test for feeding & testing data to the machine.

STEPS TO IMPLIMENTATION:

• 1st import pandas Library.
• 2nd set the data path properly in our code.
• 3rd Display the data.
• 4th check null data present or not in our dataset.
• 5th check how meany catagory are there in each columns.
• 6th replace the "?" to "others” .
• 7th remove unwanted rows and collumns.
• 8th now plot the data using mathplotlib.
• 9th remove unwanted data using the main data that no more effect or contribute.
• 10th Now seperate the input & output data.
• 11th now convert all catagorical value to numerical value.
• 12th now scale the data for normalisation.
• 13th now import accuracy_score for measure the accuracy.
• 14th Plot the results & compare which one model is best to gave outcome accuracy.
• 15th now save the best model for future use.
• 16th now import streamlit.
• 17th install pyngrok.
• 18th now generate our token key.
• 19th now deploy the web application.

CONCLUSION:

The MLP model achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 85.4%, outperforming the other two models.
Then i am saved the trained MLP model and built a simple Streamlit application to demonstrate how the model can be
used for prediction with new input data.
